# Contributing to the Project

## Workflow

1. **Feature Branches**:
   - Create a feature branch from `develop` for your changes.

2. **Pull Requests**:
   - All pull requests should be made to the `develop` branch.
   - PRs made directly to the `master` branch will be automatically rejected.

3. **Merging to Main**:
   - Once changes are reviewed and approved in the `develop` branch, a pull request can be made from `develop` to `master`.

4. **Branch Protection**:
   - The `master` branch is protected and requires reviews before merging.
   - The `develop` branch also requires reviews before merging.
